# EE354Project
Final project for EE354 (Introduction to Digital Circuits) at the University of Southern California. We designed a maze that can be navigated using buttons on the Digilent Nexys3 Board. Collaborated with Justin Calderon (https://github.com/JustinFCalderon) and Edgar Martinez (https://github.com/naaonethree).

Note: I believe I am missing 2 files but I cannot find them.
